## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. BUS-001: Generated images are low quality

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - The quality of generative AI can be inconsistent and may not meet the commercial standards of sellers.
**Impact**: High (3) - If the images are not useful, the core value proposition of the feature is lost, leading to user dissatisfaction and churn.
**Mitigation**:
- **Strategy**: Preventive/Detective
- **Actions**:
  - Implement a mechanism for users to rate the generated images.
  - Use a prompt engineering strategy that is optimized for commercial product photography.
  - Allow for re-generation of images if the user is not satisfied (potentially for a reduced credit cost).
- **Testing Requirements**:
  - User acceptance testing (UAT) with a sample group of sellers to evaluate image quality.
  - A/B testing of different prompts to see which ones deliver better results.

### 2. TECH-001: Integration with AI service fails

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - External API dependencies are a common point of failure due to network issues, service outages, or API changes.
**Impact**: High (3) - The feature is entirely dependent on this integration, making it unusable if the integration fails.
**Mitigation**:
- **Strategy**: Corrective
- **Actions**:
  - Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls.
  - Implement a circuit breaker pattern to avoid cascading failures.
  - Provide clear feedback to the user when the service is unavailable.
  - Set up monitoring and alerting for the AI service's health endpoint.
- **Testing Requirements**:
  - Integration tests that mock failure scenarios from the AI service.
  - Chaos engineering principles to test the resilience of the integration.

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                       | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| BUS-001  | Generated images are low quality  | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| TECH-001 | Integration with AI service fails | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| PERF-001 | Image generation is too slow      | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| DATA-001 | Credits not consumed correctly    | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
| SEC-001  | Malicious product data injection  | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **(BUS-001)**: Conduct UAT with target users to validate the quality and commercial viability of the generated images against a predefined quality rubric.
- **(TECH-001)**: Create integration tests that specifically handle API timeouts, 5xx error codes, and unexpected payloads from the AI service.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **(PERF-001)**: Establish a baseline for image generation time and set up performance monitoring to track it. The frontend should have a clear, user-friendly progress indicator that includes estimated time.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- **(DATA-001)**: Add transactional integrity tests to ensure that credits are deducted if and only if the image generation process is successfully initiated.
- **(SEC-001)**: Implement input sanitization and validation on the product data fields to prevent common injection attacks. Add tests for this validation.
