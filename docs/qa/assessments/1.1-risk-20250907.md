Date: 2025-09-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 56/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [DATA-001]: Inconsistent Database State

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Without an automated migration process, it is highly likely that the database schema will become inconsistent across different environments (local, staging, production).
**Impact**: High - Schema inconsistencies can lead to application errors, data corruption, and downtime.
**Mitigation**:
- Implement an automated database migration process in the CI/CD pipeline.
- Use a database migration tool (like Supabase CLI) to manage schema changes.
- Ensure that the application code and database schema are always in sync.
**Testing Focus**:
- Test the migration process thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production.
- Verify that migrations can be rolled back in case of failure.

| Risk ID  | Description                               | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| DATA-001 | Inconsistent Database State               | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |

| SEC-001  | Supabase Keys Exposure                    | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
| TECH-001 | Incorrect Monorepo Configuration          | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- Test the automated migration deployment in the CI/CD pipeline.
- Test migration rollback scenarios.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- Test the manual migration process as a fallback.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Regularly review and audit the CI/CD pipeline configuration.
- Perform security scans to detect any leaked credentials.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All critical risks (score 9).
- High risks affecting security/data.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Medium risks with compensating controls.
- Low risks with monitoring in place.

## Monitoring Requirements

- Monitor the CI/CD pipeline for migration failures.
- Set up alerts for any unauthorized access attempts to Supabase.
