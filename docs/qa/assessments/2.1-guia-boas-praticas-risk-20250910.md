Date: 2025-09-10
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 7
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 38/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [TECH-001]: Regressions in upload flow due to UI changes
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium — UI additions near upload controls can break flows.
**Impact**: High — Upload failures block core functionality.
**Mitigation**:
- Keep tips component isolated from upload handlers and forms.
- Add comprehensive UI/E2E regression tests for upload and progress states.
- Use feature flag for gradual rollout.
**Testing Focus**: Verify tips render without affecting file selection, progress, and completion.

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                                               | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation Actions |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------------------ |
| TECH-001 | Upload flow regression from layout/DOM changes.                           | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Isolation, UI/E2E regression tests, feature flag. |
| BUS-001  | Tips clutter reduces conversion/throughput.                               | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Keep concise tips, A/B test wording and placement. |
| TECH-002 | Accessibility issues (focus order, SR labels).                            | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | a11y audit, keyboard nav tests, aria-labels. |
| PERF-001 | Increased bundle/layout cost from tips component.                          | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Lazy render, avoid heavy assets, measure TTI. |
| TECH-003 | i18n/long strings causing overflow.                                       | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Responsive layout, truncation/tooltip. |
| OPS-001  | Missing feature flag/kill switch.                                         | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Add flag; enable gradual rollout and quick rollback. |
| TECH-004 | Visual regression on small screens.                                       | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Low      | Responsive tests, snapshot checks across breakpoints. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- E2E upload flow (with tips visible): select→progress→complete.
- Unit/UI tests: tips render; upload elements remain accessible and functional.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- a11y checks (keyboard, screen reader, contrast).
- Copy/i18n length variants; ensure no overlap with controls.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Performance/bundle diff; TTI before/after.
- Responsive visual regression (mobile/tablet/desktop).

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- TECH-001 (upload regression) and key a11y issues.

### Can Deploy With Mitigation
- BUS-001 (monitor conversion), PERF-001 (monitor TTI), OPS-001 (feature flag present).

### Accepted Risks
- Minor visual regressions on rare viewports (monitor via feedback).

## Monitoring Requirements

- Track upload start/success rates and time-to-complete.
- Monitor errors on upload interactions and drop-offs on the upload step.
- a11y error reports or user feedback related to readability.
