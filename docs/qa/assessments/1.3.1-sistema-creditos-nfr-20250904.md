# NFR Assessment: 1.3.1 - Sistema de Cr√©ditos

Date: 2025-09-04
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- **Security**: CONCERNS - Missing rate limiting on credit-related APIs exposes the system to abuse.
- **Performance**: PASS - No specific performance requirements were defined, and the current implementation is likely sufficient for initial use.
- **Reliability**: FAIL - The core credit allocation and consumption logic is not atomic or idempotent, leading to high-risk data inconsistencies.
- **Maintainability**: CONCERNS - The lack of robust tests for critical business logic makes the system difficult and risky to maintain or extend.

## Critical Issues

1.  **Lack of Atomic Operations (Reliability - FAIL)**
    -   **Risk**: High probability of inconsistent credit data (e.g., users with no credits or multiple initial credit grants).
    -   **Fix**: Refactor the credit allocation logic to use a single atomic transaction (e.g., a Supabase RPC function).

2.  **Missing Idempotency (Reliability - FAIL)**
    -   **Risk**: Users can be charged multiple times for a single action due to network retries, leading to customer dissatisfaction and financial loss.
    -   **Fix**: Implement an idempotency key mechanism on the credit consumption endpoint.

3.  **No Rate Limiting (Security - CONCERNS)**
    -   **Risk**: The credit endpoints are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and other forms of abuse.
    -   **Fix**: Implement rate limiting on all credit-related API endpoints.

## Quick Wins / Recommended Actions

-   **Immediate Priority**: Address the `Reliability` failures by refactoring the credit allocation and consumption logic. This is essential for the system's integrity.
-   **High Priority**: Implement rate limiting to mitigate the security risk.
-   **Medium Priority**: Add comprehensive integration tests for the new atomic and idempotent logic to improve `Maintainability` and ensure the fixes are effective.

This assessment highlights critical architectural flaws that must be addressed before the feature can be considered stable or secure.
