# Risk Profile: Story 1.2

Date: 2025-09-04
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 67/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [SEC-001]: Improper handling of OAuth 2.0 tokens
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Depends on developer experience with OAuth.
**Impact**: High - Unauthorized account access.
**Mitigation**:
- Store tokens securely (e.g., encrypted in the database).
- Use short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens to get new ones.
- Never expose tokens to the frontend. The backend should handle all token logic.
**Testing Focus**: Security testing to ensure tokens are not exposed and code review of the token handling logic.

### 2. [SEC-002]: State parameter not used or validated in OAuth flow
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Common mistake if not following best practices.
**Impact**: High - Account takeover.
**Mitigation**:
- Generate a unique, unguessable `state` parameter for each authentication request.
- Store the `state` parameter in the user's session.
- After the user is redirected back from Google, compare the `state` parameter from the redirect with the one stored in the session.
**Testing Focus**: Security testing to attempt CSRF attacks and unit tests for the state validation logic.

| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEC-001  | Improper handling of OAuth 2.0 tokens.    | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Store tokens securely (encrypted), use short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens, and never expose tokens to the frontend.                                                                               |
| SEC-002  | State parameter not used or validated.    | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Generate and validate a unique `state` parameter for each authentication request to prevent CSRF.                                                                                                       |
| DATA-001 | Incomplete user profile data.             | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Define minimum required user profile data and prompt users to complete their profile if necessary.                                                                                                        |
| BUS-001  | User drop-off due to permission requests. | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Only request the minimum necessary scopes from Google (`openid`, `email`, `profile`) and clearly explain why more permissions are needed if applicable.                                                     |
| TECH-001 | Dependency on Google's availability.      | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      | Implement robust error handling and monitoring for the Google authentication flow and consider an alternative login method as a future fallback.                                                              |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- Security testing to ensure OAuth 2.0 tokens are not exposed.
- Code review of the token handling logic.
- Security testing to attempt CSRF attacks on the OAuth 2.0 flow.
- Unit tests for the state validation logic.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- Functional testing of the registration flow with different Google profiles (e.g., with missing data).
- Usability testing of the consent screen to ensure it's not requesting excessive permissions.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Integration testing with mock failures from the Google API to test error handling.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All high-risk items (SEC-001, SEC-002) must be mitigated.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Medium risks (DATA-001, BUS-001) can be deployed with the proposed mitigation strategies in place.

### Accepted Risks
- The risk of dependency on Google's availability (TECH-001) is accepted for the initial implementation.

## Monitoring Requirements

- Monitor for authentication errors and failures.
- Set up alerts for any unusual activity related to authentication.
