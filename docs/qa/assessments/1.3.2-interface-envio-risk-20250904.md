Date: 2025-09-04
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Medium Risks: 3
- Low Risks: 2
- Overall Risk Score: 55/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [SEC-001]: Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Without explicit server-side validation, this is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability.
**Impact**: High (3) - Allows remote code execution, leading to complete server compromise.
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict server-side validation to only allow specific image file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .png, .webp).
- Verify the file's MIME type on the server.
- Store uploaded files in a non-executable directory outside of the web root.
- Use a file name sanitization process to prevent directory traversal attacks.
**Testing Focus**: Upload files with various malicious extensions (.exe, .php, .js) and verify they are rejected. Attempt to upload a valid image with a fake malicious extension.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (Must be automated)
- **SEC-001**: Security testing focused on file uploads. Create a test suite that attempts to upload various disallowed file types and extensions. Verify that the server rejects them with a clear error message.
- **SEC-003**: Integration tests to verify that file uploads exceeding a defined size limit are rejected.
- **DATA-001**: E2E tests that simulate network interruptions during file upload to ensure the system can recover gracefully.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **SEC-002**: Automated security scanning (e.g., OWASP ZAP) and manual penetration testing of input fields. Unit tests for input sanitization functions.
- **PERF-001/PERF-002**: Frontend performance profiling to ensure the UI remains responsive during uploads. Backend load testing to measure server performance under concurrent uploads.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **BUS-001**: Usability testing with target users to gather feedback on the interface clarity.
- **TECH-001**: Visual regression testing to ensure UI consistency with the existing application.
