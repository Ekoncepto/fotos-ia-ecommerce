## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy | Testing Focus | Residual Risk | Owner | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TECH-001 | Inconsistent Credit Allocation on Signup | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Implement atomic transactions for credit allocation. Add robust unit and integration tests for signup flow. | Test various signup scenarios, including concurrent signups, edge cases (e.g., network issues during credit allocation). | Low | Dev | Before deployment |
| TECH-002 | Credit Consumption Logic Errors | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Implement server-side validation for credit deduction requests. Use idempotent operations for credit consumption. | Extensive unit and integration tests for credit deduction, including negative balance scenarios, concurrent image generation requests. | Low | Dev | Before deployment |
| SEC-001 | Credit Manipulation/Exploitation | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Implement strong authentication and authorization for all credit-related API endpoints. Rate limiting on credit-related actions. Server-side validation of all credit requests. | Penetration testing, security audits, fuzz testing on credit APIs. | Low | Dev | Before deployment |
| PERF-001 | Slow Credit Balance Display | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Optimize database queries for credit balance. Implement caching for frequently accessed credit data. | Load testing on credit balance API. | Minimal | Dev | Before deployment |
| BUS-001 | Unclear "Insufficient Credits" Message | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Conduct UX review of the "insufficient credits" message. A/B test different message variations. | User acceptance testing (UAT) for clarity of messages. | Minimal | UX/PO | Before deployment |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

_None identified for this story._

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **TECH-001 (Inconsistent Credit Allocation on Signup):**
    - Test scenarios: Concurrent user registrations, network interruptions during signup, edge cases for credit amount (e.g., zero, negative if applicable).
    - Required test types: Unit tests for credit allocation logic, integration tests for signup flow, stress tests for concurrent signups.
    - Test data requirements: Various user profiles, simulated network conditions.
- **TECH-002 (Credit Consumption Logic Errors):**
    - Test scenarios: Image generation with exact credit amount, insufficient credits, multiple concurrent image generations, edge cases for credit deduction (e.g., zero credits remaining).
    - Required test types: Unit tests for credit deduction logic, integration tests for image generation flow, performance tests for concurrent deductions.
    - Test data requirements: Users with varying credit balances, image generation requests with different credit costs.
- **SEC-001 (Credit Manipulation/Exploitation):**
    - Test scenarios: Attempting to bypass credit checks, injecting malicious data into credit-related requests, unauthorized access to credit APIs.
    - Required test types: Penetration testing, security audits, fuzz testing on credit APIs, authorization tests.
    - Test data requirements: Malicious payloads, unauthorized user tokens.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **PERF-001 (Slow Credit Balance Display):**
    - Test scenarios: Displaying credit balance for users with large transaction histories, concurrent users checking balances.
    - Required test types: Load testing on credit balance API, UI performance testing.
- **BUS-001 (Unclear "Insufficient Credits" Message):**
    - Test scenarios: User attempts to generate images with insufficient credits, verify message clarity and actionability.
    - Required test types: User acceptance testing (UAT), A/B testing.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6): TECH-001, TECH-002, SEC-001.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Low risks (score 2): PERF-001, BUS-001, with monitoring and UX review in place.

### Accepted Risks

- No risks are explicitly accepted without mitigation.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **TECH-001:** Error rates in user registration and credit allocation services.
- **TECH-002:** Error rates in image generation and credit deduction services, credit balance discrepancies.
- **SEC-001:** Security alerts for credit-related API endpoints, unusual activity in credit balances.
- **PERF-001:** Response times for credit balance display.
- **BUS-001:** User feedback on "insufficient credits" message, conversion rates for image generation.
