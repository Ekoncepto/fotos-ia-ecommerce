Date: 2025-09-10
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 10
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 68/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [SEC-001]: Prompt injection and unsafe instruction following
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium — Free-form text inputs invite injection attempts.
**Impact**: High — Could lead to disallowed outputs or system misuse.
**Mitigation**:
- Layered prompt guardrails; strict output schemas; content policy enforcement.
- Input sanitization/encoding for any UI render; rate limits.
- Security tests with known injection patterns.
**Testing Focus**: Adversarial prompts; output filtering; logging/trace of refusal reasons.

### 2. [TECH-001]: Conversation state/credit accounting errors
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium — Stateful flows with limits are error-prone.
**Impact**: High — Incorrect quotas, loops, or lost context degrade UX/cost.
**Mitigation**:
- Single source of truth for state; atomic updates; idempotency.
- Clear limits per package; explicit error messages; resilient retries.
- Integration tests for sequential refinements and edge limits.
**Testing Focus**: Multi-step refinement sequences; concurrent requests; limit enforcement.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- Adversarial injection prompts; ensure policy adherence/refusals/logging.
- Multi-step refinement with quota enforcement and persistence of context.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- XSS render checks; CSP header verification.
- Latency bounds with growing context; summarization correctness.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Concurrency tests for simultaneous refinements.
- Observability: traces/metrics per refinement step.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001, TECH-001; ensure XSS mitigations in UI.

### Can Deploy With Mitigation
- Latency/cost controls; observability improvements.

### Accepted Risks
- Minor UX mismatch initially; addressed iteratively with examples and guidance.

## Monitoring Requirements

- Track refinement success, refusal reasons, and latency by step.
- Rate limit breach alerts; error budgets for failures.
