    title: 'Generated images are low quality'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Address the potential for low-quality images by implementing feedback loops and better prompt strategies.'
      - 'Build resilience into the AI service integration with error handling and circuit breakers.'
    monitor:
      - 'Track image generation times to ensure they stay within an acceptable range.'
