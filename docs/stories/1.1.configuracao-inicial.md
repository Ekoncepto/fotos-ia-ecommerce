# História 1.1: Configuração Inicial

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**Como** desenvolvedor,
**eu quero** configurar a estrutura do monorepo com os projetos de frontend, backend e a pipeline de CI/CD,
**para que** tenhamos uma base sólida, automatizada e pronta para o desenvolvimento e deploy.

## Critérios de Aceitação
1. O monorepo deve ser inicializado com a estrutura de pastas para apps (frontend/backend) e packages (código compartilhado).
2. O projeto frontend (aplicação web) deve ser criado e configurado.
3. O projeto backend (serviços serverless) deve ser criado e configurado.
4. Uma pipeline de CI/CD básica deve ser configurada para rodar testes e fazer deploy em um ambiente de desenvolvimento.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Initialize Monorepo Structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `apps` and `packages` directories.
  - [x] Create root `package.json` and `turbo.json`.
  - [x] Create `.gitignore` file.
- [x] Task 2: Create Shared Packages (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `packages/config` for shared TS/ESLint configs.
  - [x] Create `packages/types` for shared data interfaces.
- [x] Task 3: Create Frontend Application (AC: 2)
  - [x] Manually scaffold Next.js application in `apps/web`.
  - [x] Configure TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
  - [x] Install all dependencies.
- [x] Task 4: Configure Backend (AC: 3)
  - [x] The architecture specifies Supabase (BaaS), so no separate backend application was created in the monorepo. The frontend is configured to interact with it.
- [x] Task 5: Configure CI/CD (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create `netlify.toml` file with build configuration.
- [x] Task 6: Configure Testing Framework
  - [x] Install and configure Vitest and React Testing Library.
  - [x] Create an initial unit test for the home page.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Jules

### Debug Log References
- Encountered and worked around multiple environment issues related to `npm install` and interactive CLIs. Switched to manual scaffolding for the frontend application to overcome blockers.

### Completion Notes List
- The entire monorepo structure has been created according to the `fullstack-architecture.md` document.
- The project is configured to use `npm` as the package manager.
- The frontend application is a standard Next.js app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Shared packages for `config` and `types` are in place.
- A testing framework (Vitest) is configured, and a sample test is included.
- **NOTE:** Test execution was skipped due to persistent environment issues, as agreed with the user. The setup should work correctly in a standard local environment.
