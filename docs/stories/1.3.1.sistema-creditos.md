# História 1.3.1: Sistema de Créditos

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**Como** um novo usuário,
**eu quero** receber um saldo inicial de créditos gratuitos ao me cadastrar,
**para que** eu possa testar a funcionalidade principal do produto.

## Critérios de Aceitação
1. Toda nova conta de usuário criada deve receber um saldo inicial de X créditos.
2. O usuário deve conseguir ver seu saldo de créditos atual na interface.
3. A geração de um pacote de imagens deve consumir um número predefinido de créditos.
4. Se o usuário não tiver créditos suficientes, o botão "Gerar Fotos" deve exibir uma mensagem clara informando a situação.

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-09-04 | 1.1 | Applied QA fixes for reliability and security. Refactored credit allocation to be atomic and improved client-side idempotency for credit consumption. Documented rate limiting as technical debt. | Jules (Dev Agent) |

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Jules (Dev Agent)

### Debug Log References
- Encountered issues with the test runner environment (`dotenv: not found`).
- Resolved the issue by modifying `vitest.config.ts` to load the `.env.test` file directly, and updated the `test` script in `package.json` to remove the `dotenv-cli` dependency. This made the test setup more robust.
- All tests passed successfully after the fixes.

### Completion Notes List
- **Atomic Credit Allocation**: Refactored the logic in `apps/web/app/auth/callback/route.ts` to use a single atomic `insert` with `onConflict` to prevent race conditions during the initial credit allocation for new users.
- **Idempotency Mitigation**: Improved the client-side logic in `apps/web/components/image-generator.tsx` by adding an `isGenerating` state to disable the "Gerar Fotos" button during the API call. This mitigates the risk of multiple credit deductions from accidental double-clicks.
- **Rate Limiting Documentation**: Documented the need for rate limiting on credit-related APIs as technical debt in `docs/tech-debt/rate-limiting.md`. This was done because implementing a robust solution requires architectural changes that are outside the scope of this task.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.3.1-sistema-creditos.yml

### Code Quality Assessment

The initial implementation had a critical race condition vulnerability in the credit deduction logic and configuration values (initial credits, generation cost) were hardcoded in multiple places. The code has been refactored to address these issues.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/web/app/api/generate-image/route.ts`
  - **Change**: Replaced the non-atomic "read-then-write" logic with a call to a new `deduct_credits` Supabase RPC function.
  - **Why**: To fix a critical race condition that could lead to incorrect credit balances.
  - **How**: The RPC function performs the credit check and deduction in a single, atomic database transaction.
- **File**: `packages/config/credits.ts` (new file)
  - **Change**: Created a new file to store shared constants for `INITIAL_CREDITS` and `IMAGE_GENERATION_COST`.
  - **Why**: To centralize configuration and avoid hardcoded values.
  - **How**: The constants are now imported and used across the frontend and backend.
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250904230000_deduct_credits_function.sql` (new file)
  - **Change**: Created a new database migration to define the `deduct_credits` function.
  - **Why**: To ensure the atomic credit deduction logic is part of the database schema and applied consistently.
  - **How**: The migration file can be applied automatically as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (with improvements)
- All ACs Met: ✓

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored credit deduction to be atomic.
- [x] Centralized credit configuration.
- [x] Added a database migration for the new function.
- [ ] Add integration tests for the credit system.
- [ ] Add concurrent tests to explicitly test for race conditions.

### Security Review

The critical race condition has been fixed.
The lack of rate limiting is still a known issue (documented as technical debt).

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues were identified.
